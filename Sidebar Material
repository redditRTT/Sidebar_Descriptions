**Description**
Road Trip Tunes is a place for people who are planning on taking a road trip or people who drive a lot to discover and experiment with different road trip playlists. Driving isn't always the most fun experience...especially when traveling on I-95, so this will hopefully ease the pain. We invite posters to contribute any songs or playlists they feel will be suitable for travel. Music can be anything from a hard rock playlist filled with AC/DC music and Guns 'N Roses to easy going Beatles music. Posters should also include the purpose of their playist and for what types of situations it should be used for.

**Rules**
* Only posts about playlists and individual songs should be posted here. Anything that is not related to music on the go will be removed by the mods.
* If songs/playlists are posted, make sure the link is a working link. Any link that has been removed for copyright purposes or that leads to a 404 error will be removed.
